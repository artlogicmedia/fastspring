# fastspring

This is a simple Python module designed to interact with the FastSpring ordering and subscription API. This module requires [xmltodict](https://github.com/martinblech/xmltodict/) to work. Data is passed into and returned from the API object in dicts.

## Methods

Each method of the API class corresponds directly to an API endpoint. The [official FastSpring API documentation](https://github.com/fastspring/fastspring-api/) is the best reference for understanding what does what. More explicit documentation will be forthcoming here in the future.

## Python 2 & Python 3

There are both Python 2 and Python 3 variants available in this repository. Please note that the Python 3 variant is untested as of this writing, and may contain bugs not present in the Python 2 version.
