# fastspring

This is a simple Python module designed to interact with the FastSpring ordering
and subscription API. This module requires
[xmltodict](https://github.com/martinblech/xmltodict/) to work. Data is passed
into and returned from the API object in dicts.

## Methods

Each method of the API class corresponds directly to an API endpoint. The
[official FastSpring API documentation](https://github.com/fastspring/fastspring-api/)
is the best reference for understanding what does what. More explicit
documentation will be forthcoming here in the future.

## Python 2 & Python 3

There are both Python 2 and Python 3 variants available in this repository.
Please note that the Python 3 variant is untested as of this writing, and may
contain bugs not present in the Python 2 version.
